## Overview
This project involves the extraction, cleaning, and visualization of real estate data from Otodom for the month of October 2023. It encompasses the entire process, from web scraping to data cleaning and analysis, followed by visualization using Power BI. The project also includes various supplementary files and notebooks for comprehensive analysis.

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to collect, clean, and visualize real estate offers from the Otodom platform for October 2023. It aims to provide insights into the real estate market trends during this period.

## Components

### Data Scraping
We utilized web scraping techniques to gather real estate offers from Otodom for October 2023. There are multiple components related to data scraping:
- The `OTD Scraping Data.ipynb` notebook contains the code enabling data scraping for different cities.
- The 'OTD' directory includes CSV files for each city used in the analysis and one consolidated file containing cleaned data after the scraping process.

### Data Cleaning
The data collected underwent a comprehensive cleaning process to handle missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers. The data cleaning process is documented in the `OTD Data Cleaning.ipynb` notebook. The output is the consolidated and cleaned CSV file found in the 'OTD' directory.

### Power BI Visualization
The `OTD Analysis.pbix` file contains visualizations created using Power BI. It combines elements from the two dashboards:
1. **Dashboard 1: Overview of Real Estate Offers by City** - Providing insights into city-wise offer counts, average prices in the primary and secondary markets, and a visualization of building construction years.
2. **Dashboard 2: City-based Property Analysis and Price Distribution** - Focusing on property offers by city, market categorization, average price per square meter, and a histogram showing price distribution.
